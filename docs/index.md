# Zero to Mastery Learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning Concepts


Hi, I'm **Moussa JAMOR** 😁.

A **Machine Learning Engineer** Student at **[ENSIAS](http://ensias.um5.ac.ma/)** 👨‍💻.


This website **Zero to Mastery Learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning Concepts** will contains all concepts and ressource materials, that I learned during my learning journey in field of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning** and **Data Science**.

## Projects

Currently, I'm working on some intersting projects:

- **[`NanoTorch`](https://github.com/JamorMoussa/NanoTorch)**: is Deep Learning Library from scratch using Numpy and Math. 

- **[`torch_utils`](https://github.com/JamorMoussa/torch_utils)**: is a PyTorch extension designed for training and building deep learning models.
